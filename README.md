## Introduction

Feliz NaviHike is a Christmas-themed hiking community app designed to bring people together during the holiday season. Encouraging outdoor activities, physical well-being, and fostering new connections, this app allows users to discover, join, and create festive walks in their local communities.

## Project Story

### Inspiration

The inspiration behind Feliz NaviHike came from a desire to blend the joy of the holiday season with the benefits of outdoor activities and community connections. Recognizing the importance of physical and mental well-being during the festive period, our team set out to create an app that encourages people to step outside, engage in Christmas-themed walks, and forge new friendships along the trail.

### What it does

Feliz NaviHike is a Christmas-themed hiking community app that allows users to discover, join, and create festive walks in their local communities. Users can create profiles, explore curated walks, view the profiles of fellow participants, and make meaningful connections as they enjoy the beauty of the outdoors during the holiday season.

### How we built it

To bring Feliz NaviHike to life, we opted for a tech stack consisting of Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. While some team members had prior experience with React, JavaScript, and CSS, using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind for the first time added an extra layer of challenge and excitement. The 7-hour time constraint posed another hurdle, prompting us to work efficiently, collaborate closely, and leverage our collective problem-solving skills.

Throughout the development process, we engaged in pair programming and tackled challenges as a cohesive team. The combination of a new tech stack, time constraints, and a collaborative approach made the project both challenging and a brilliant learning experience.

### Challenges we ran into

The main challenges we encountered included the adoption of Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS within the tight timeframe. Adapting to the nuances of these technologies required rapid learning and adaptation. Additionally, designing, ideating, and building an entire app in just 7 hours posed a significant time pressure. Despite these challenges, our team worked seamlessly, overcoming obstacles together.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're immensely proud of the end result: Feliz NaviHike, a fully functional app that seamlessly blends Christmas spirit, outdoor adventure, and community engagement. Our ability to learn and adapt to new technologies on the fly, coupled with effective teamwork, enabled us to deliver a project we are genuinely proud of.

### What we learned

The project served as an outstanding learning experience for our team. We gained proficiency in Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, expanding our technical skill set. The collaborative nature of the development process enhanced our teamwork, communication, and problem-solving abilities.

### What's next for Feliz NaviHike

Looking ahead, Feliz NaviHike has exciting prospects. We plan to refine and expand the app, incorporating user feedback, enhancing features, and exploring opportunities for further community engagement. The journey doesn't end here; Feliz NaviHike is poised to continue spreading holiday cheer, one hike at a time.
